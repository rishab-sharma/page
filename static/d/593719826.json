Image matting and background detection can be achieved easily through chroma keying in a studio setting when the background is either pure green or blue. Nonetheless, image matting in natural scenes with complex and uneven depth backgrounds remains a tedious task that requires human intervention. To achieve complete automatic foreground extraction in natural scenes, we propose a method that assimilates semantic segmentation and deep image matting processes into a single network to generate detailed semantic mattes for image composition task. The contribution of our proposed method is two-fold, firstly it can be interpreted as a fully automated semantic image matting method and secondly as a refinement of existing semantic segmentation models. We propose a novel model architecture as a combination of segmentation and matting that unifies the function of upsampling and downsampling operators with the notion of attention.","iframe":"//arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03613.pdf","src":"//arxiv.org/abs/2003.03613","title":"AlphaNet- An Attention Guided Deep Network for Automatic Image Matting"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/alpha-net-an-attention-guided-deep-network-for-automatic-image-matting"}}},{"node":{"id":"8756464e-2478-511d-b667-977d7a57de0a","frontmatter":{"demo":"//bugvilla.herokuapp.com/","excerpt":"Universal bug tracker for everyone!
