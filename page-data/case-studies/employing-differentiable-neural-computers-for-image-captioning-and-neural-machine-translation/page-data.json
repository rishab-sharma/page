They learn to do so using the magic of optimisation: when a DNC produces an answer, we compare the answer to a desired correct answer. Over time, the controller learns to produce answers that are closer and closer to the correct answer. In the process, it figures out how to use its memory.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/employing-differentiable-neural-computers-for-image-captioning-and-neural-machine-translation"},"frontmatter":{"iframe":"//sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920315325/pdf?md5=a52136479476cc66a52994a1cc967006&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050920315325-main.pdf","src":"//sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920315325","title":"Employing Differentiable Neural Computers for Image Captioning and Neural Machine Translation","info":{"idea":"In this paper, we tackled two main tasks, one is language translation and other is image captioning using Differentiable Neural Computers","links":[["Paper","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920315325/pdf?md5=a52136479476cc66a52994a1cc967006&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050920315325-main.pdf"],["Paper Website","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920315325"]],"tech":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","NLP","NTM"]}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/case-studies/employing-differentiable-neural-computers-for-image-captioning-and-neural-machine-translation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1033876704"]}
