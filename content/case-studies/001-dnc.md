title: Employing Differentiable Neural Computers for Image Captioning and Neural Machine Translation
excerpt:
  In the history of artificial neural networks, LSTMs have proved to be a high-performance architecture at sequential data learning. Although LSTMs are remarkable in learning sequential data but are limited in their ability to learn long-term dependencies and representation of certain data structures because of the lack of external memory. In this paper, we tackled two main tasks, one is language translation and other is image captioning. We approached the problem of language translation by leveraging the capabilities of the recently developed DNC architectures. Here we modified the DNC architecture by including dual neural controllers instead of one and an external memory module. Inside our controller, we employed a neural network with memory-augmentation which differs from the original differentiable neural computer, we implemented a dual controller’s system in which one controller is for encoding the query sequence whereas another controller is for decoding the translated sequences.

## ✨ Differentiable Neural Computer

Differentiable neural computers learn how to use memory and how to produce answers completely from scratch. They learn to do so using the magic of optimisation: when a DNC produces an answer, we compare the answer to a desired correct answer. Over time, the controller learns to produce answers that are closer and closer to the correct answer. In the process, it figures out how to use its memory.
